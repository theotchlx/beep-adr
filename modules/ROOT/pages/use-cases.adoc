DDD/use case ADR

//TODO: find the right vocabulary to refer to functional neighborhoods/business capabilities/units/etc. in the right places. Be clear and concise.

The following sections concern my proposal to separate the Beep application into functional neighborhoods and microservices.

Before we can separate Beep into services, we need to have an idea of how Beep's functionalities can be grouped into autonomous business units/ functionality neighboroods. +

//TODO: review if this is summary still correct (and needed?).
1. For that purpose, we will first identify the user stories that define how people interface with Beep's functionalities.
2. Then, building on that, we will classify the identified functionalities of Beep into logical groups, or business capabilities/functionalities neighborhoods.
3. Lastly, from these logical groupings of functionalities, we will propose a separation of Beep into functional neighborhoods and microservices.
// Saying "functional neighborhood", "user story", "business capability" so soon, before explaining what they are, may be a bad idea, and confuse the reader.

~== 1. Identifying user stories

In this section, I will identify the user stories that make up Beep's functionalities.

[TIP]
A user story is an informal, natural language description of feature from the perspective of the end user. It typically follows the format: "As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason]".
